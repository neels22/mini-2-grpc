## Quick Commands

### Run the System
```bash
./test_phase2.sh
```

### Manual Start (single computer, all Python servers)
```bash
cd mini-2-grpc
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start in separate terminals (or with &)
python3 team_green/server_c.py configs/process_c.json &   # Worker C
python3 team_pink/server_d.py configs/process_d.json &    # Worker D
python3 team_pink/server_f.py configs/process_f.json &    # Worker F
python3 team_green/server_b.py configs/process_b.json &   # Leader B
python3 team_pink/server_e.py configs/process_e.json &    # Leader E
python3 gateway/server.py configs/process_a.json &        # Gateway A
```

### Run Client
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 client/test_client.py
```

### Stop Everything
```bash
pkill -f server_
pkill -f "python3 gateway"
pkill -f "python3 team_"
```

## System Architecture

```
Client
  ↓
Gateway A (localhost:50051)
  ├─→ Team Green Leader B (localhost:50052)
  │     ├─→ Worker C (localhost:50053) - 243K measurements
  │     └─→ Worker D (localhost:50054) - 244K measurements
  └─→ Team Pink Leader E (localhost:50055)
        └─→ Worker F (localhost:50056) - 300K measurements

B has 134K local, E has 245K local
Total: 1,167,525 measurements
```

**For multi-computer:** Replace `localhost` with actual IPs
